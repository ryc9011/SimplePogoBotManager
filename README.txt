Hello and welcome to Simple Pokemon Go Bot Manager!
Before starting, you must have the following programs:

1. Necrobot, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/NECROBOTIO/NecroBot/wiki/Compiled-Releases

2. PogoLocationFeeder, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/5andr0/PogoLocationFeeder/releases/

3. QuickSpin, which can be downloaded here:
http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/pokemon-go/pokemon-go-hacks-cheats/565264-quickspin-pokemongo-softban-unbanner-quickly-unbans-your-softbanned-account.html

Unzip the files and place them somewhere convenient, follow the instructions on those sites for installing them, and 
then fill out the paths to those files by editing config.bat (To edit config.bat, right click it and then click Edit.)
For reference, a file path would look something like this: C:\Users\Bob\Release\NecroBot.exe
Then, start PogoBotManager.bat to begin!

Happy botting!
