Hello and welcome to Simple Pokemon Go Bot Manager!
Before starting, you must have the following programs:

1. Necrobot, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/NECROBOTIO/NecroBot/wiki/Compiled-Releases

2. PogoLocationFeeder, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/5andr0/PogoLocationFeeder/releases/

3. QuickSpin, which can be downloaded here:

Unzip the files and place them somewhere convenient, follow the instructions on those sites for installing them, and 
then fill out the paths to those files by editing config.bat (To edit config.bat, right click it and then click Edit.)
For reference, the folder path would look something like this:
C:\Users\Bob\Release if the location of Necrobot.exe is located at C:\Users\Bob\Release\Necrobot.exe

**IMPORTANT!** For now please do not place Necrobot.exe in a directory with spaces in between.
C:\Users\Bob\Release is fine, C:\Users\Bob\Pokemon Bot\Release is not fine. I will work on a fix/workaround shortly.

Then, start PogoBotManager.bat to begin! This program only supports a maximum of 5 accounts at a time.

Happy botting!
