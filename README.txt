**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
As of this day, 8/12/16, NecroBot and many others were taken down due to legal action from Niantic.
Therefore, this program will no lonnger be developed/updated.
In addition, botters have reported permanent bans. Although unconfirmed so far, it is recommended to bot as human as possible, if at all. Botting is done at your own risk and is not recommended until the botting community receives more information. It appears to be extended softbans only for now, but this is unconfirmed as well. Check Discord channels for up-to-date information, as well as /r/pokemongobotting. If you decide to bot, do not use sniping, as this may further increase your chance of being banned.

Hello and welcome to Simple Pokemon Go Bot Manager!
Before starting, you must have the following programs:

1. Necrobot, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/NECROBOTIO/NecroBot/wiki/Compiled-Releases <-- Removed

2. PogoLocationFeeder, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/5andr0/PogoLocationFeeder/releases/ <-- Do not snipe, currently unsafe

3. QuickSpin, which can be downloaded here:
http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/pokemon-go/pokemon-go-hacks-cheats/565264-quickspin-pokemongo-softban-unbanner-quickly-unbans-your-softbanned-account.html <-- Not currently working

Next, check out the SimplePogoBotManager wiki for information, download link, and more:
https://github.com/ryc9011/SimplePogoBotManager/wiki

Unzip the files and place them somewhere convenient, follow the instructions on those sites for installing them, and 
then fill out necessary info in config.bat (Right click config.bat > Edit)
DO NOT rename any bot executable or any of the files you downloaded in the ZIP with this program.

**IMPORTANT!** For now please do not place your bots in a directory with spaces in between.
C:\Users\Bob\Release is fine, C:\Users\Bob\Pokemon Bot\Release is not fine. I will work on a fix/workaround soon^TM.

Then, start PogoBotManager.bat to begin! This program only supports a maximum of 5 accounts at a time.
If you've correctly set up config.bat, the program will execute properly.

Happy botting!
