Hello and welcome to Simple Pokemon Go Bot Manager!
Before starting, you must have the following programs:

1. Necrobot, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/NECROBOTIO/NecroBot/wiki/Compiled-Releases

2. PogoLocationFeeder, which can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/5andr0/PogoLocationFeeder/releases/

3. QuickSpin, which can be downloaded here:
http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/pokemon-go/pokemon-go-hacks-cheats/565264-quickspin-pokemongo-softban-unbanner-quickly-unbans-your-softbanned-account.html

Unzip the files and place them somewhere convenient, follow the instructions on those sites for installing them, and 
then fill out necessary info in config.bat (Right click config.bat > Edit)
DO NOT rename any bot executable or any of the files you downloaded in the ZIP with this program.

**IMPORTANT!** For now please do not place your bots in a directory with spaces in between.
C:\Users\Bob\Release is fine, C:\Users\Bob\Pokemon Bot\Release is not fine. I will work on a fix/workaround soon^TM.

Then, start PogoBotManager.bat to begin! This program only supports a maximum of 5 accounts at a time.
If you've correctly set up config.bat, the program will execute properly.

Happy botting!
